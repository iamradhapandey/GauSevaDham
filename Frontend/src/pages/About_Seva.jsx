            Gau Seva Dham is a divine center established under the pious guidance of Devi Chitralekha Ji,
            committed to the service and protection of Gau Mata (holy cows). This sacred place is not just a shelter,
            but a living embodiment of Dharma and selfless service.
          </span>
          <span className="block mb-4">
            Hundreds of cows, especially those injured, abandoned, or in critical condition, are lovingly cared for here.
            They are provided with nutritious food, proper medical treatment, and a peaceful environment where they can live with dignity.
          </span>
          <span className="block mb-4">
            The seva doesn‚Äôt stop at physical care‚Äîdaily rituals, devotional bhajans, and spiritual practices are held to uplift the
            divine vibration of the place. Volunteers and devotees gather to participate in this sacred mission of service and devotion.
          </span>
          <span className="block mb-4">
            Under the inspiration of Devi Chitralekha Ji, this initiative has become a beacon of Sanatan values‚Äîpromoting kindness,
            ahimsa (non-violence), and a deep respect for all forms of life.
          </span>
          <span className="block mb-4">
            Gau Seva Dham is also a place for transformation‚Äîwhere people come not only to serve but to find peace, purpose, and spiritual connection.
            Many devotees have shared life-changing experiences after spending time here in seva and satsang.
          </span>
          <span className="block">
            The mission continues to grow, with the grace of Devi Ji and support of the devotees, spreading the message of compassion,
            love, and dharma across the nation and beyond.
